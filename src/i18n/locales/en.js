      bio: "Hi there! I’m Obsidian!\nI live in Hsinchu and work as a backend software engineer.\nIt’s always been a dream of mine to create a website of my own—so here it is! I’m super excited to share it with you, and I really hope you like it! If you spot any bugs or have suggestions, feel free to reach out—I’m always happy to learn and improve!\n\nEven before having a fursona, I was already actively participating in all sorts of furry events. Through a wonderful twist of fate, I was lucky enough to be entrusted with the character “Obsidian.”\nIt’s been exactly one year since I officially joined the fandom, and I’ve been loving every moment of it! I’ve had so much fun, and now I want to spread that joy to all of you, too!\n\nSo come say hi, give me a boop or a hug, and let’s have fun together!\nLooking forward to getting to know you all!",
